i desided to make two boxes because everytime I tried to make it stick to the screen it messed with the page.
After many atemps of trying to make the nav bar move with the page i was not able to, without it being coverd by the pictures
I had to search how to do the home link.
I did not know how to put the three links together so I searched up help.
I added a js code but for some reason it still dose not show anything 
I do not really understand js so i dont know how to make it show anything.
